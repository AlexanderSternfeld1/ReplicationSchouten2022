# ReplicationSchouten2022
This github page provides the code for replicating the results of the following paper:

Schouten, T. N., Dekker, R., Hekimoğlu, M., &amp; Eruguz, A. S. (2022). Maintenance optimization for a single wind turbine component under time-varying costs. European Journal of Operational Research, 300 (3), 979–991. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2021.09.009

Specifically, Table 2 on page 985 is replicated, which leads to a replication that gives the same results as Schouten (2022) up to the third decimal.

In the code, one should first specify the type of model, the Weibull parameters and the cost parameters. Then, one can optimize the corresponding model.
